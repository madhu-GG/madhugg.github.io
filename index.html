<h2> Welcome to my corner! </h2>
<p> This is my corner of "The Internet" or as people often prefer, the World Wide Web. <span class="subconscious"> (Sorry, I am a bit old) </span> </p>

<h3> A bit about myself <span class="subconscious"> (I promise, I am not self-obsessed... or am I?) </span> </h3>
<p> I am a software engineer <span class="subconscious"> (You probably knew already) </span> with 10 years of age in the industry, mainly in attending meetings. But also, working with routers and looking at other people's C code that drives the Internet. </p>

<p> I started this website <span class="subconscious">(for vain and glory)</span> to have some escape and explore the wide breadth of what software and computing has to offer. I wanted to chronicle my experiences (again, for vain and glory) to build a nice memory of what I have learnt over the years and my stumbles. </p>

<p class="subconscious"> Note from the subconscious: This man never completes his adventures. I am sure he gets abducted by aliens mid-way through this and we never hear the conclusion </p>

<section id="works">
	<h2> Works </h2>
	<p> This section is blank <span class="subconscious">(Like I said, the man suffers from chronic cliff-hanger syndrome)</span> </p>

	<p> This section is dedicated to a place where I can write <span class="subconscious">(boo, more like type... how long has it been since he lifted up a pen?)</span> </p>

<section id="about">
	<h2> About </h2>
	<p class="subconscious"> sub-conscious: What do you mean "about"? Haven't you talked about yourself enough already? </p>
